                During his early career, he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[19] Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.[3] He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.

                In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[21] In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to include more engineers.
