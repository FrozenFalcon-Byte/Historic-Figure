                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu). His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. </p>
