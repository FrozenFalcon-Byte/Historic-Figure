                    <h1>Pokhran-II</h1>
                    <p>From 1992 to 1999 Kalam was scientific adviser to India's defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the government, with the rank of cabinet minister. During this period he played a key role in the government's weaponization of missile systems, giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 he was one of the chief coordinators of the Pokhran-II series of nuclear tests, in which five bombs were detonated at a test range in the town of Pokhran, Rajasthan state. His prominent role in the country's nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.</p>
